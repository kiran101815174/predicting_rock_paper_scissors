# predicting_rock_paper_scissors
this is a small deep learning projects developed using convolutional neural netoworks ,where i developed a model which could predict if the image is either rock or paper or scissor
Rock Paper Scissors is a dataset containing 2,892 images of diverse hands in Rock/Paper/Scissors poses. It is licensed CC By 2.0 and available for all purposes, but it’s intent is primarily for learning and research.

Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such.
Note that all of this data is posed against a white background.

Each image is 300×300 pixels in 24-bit color
